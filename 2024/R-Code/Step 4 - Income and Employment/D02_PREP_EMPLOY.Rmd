# Prepare Employment

Prepare the employment data for analysis. This file executes the step-wise median-replacements of income for each re-sample based on values as well as deals with other missing information such as missing employment info for a household, unknown age class, and other logical considerations.

## Change log

### Change 1
- Programmer: D.S.Koster  
- Date: 09/2023  
- Change Description: Added an ungroup to employData at the end of the script to prevent unecessary grouping columns from being added to the HH Database file.  
- Template Update [Y|N]: Yes  
- One-Off: No - all future scripts should incorporate this change  

### Change 2
- Programmer: D.S.Koster  
- Date: 04/23/2024  
- Change Description: Updated organization and formatting to be more consistent and provide better feedback/output.  
- Template Update [Y|N]: Y  
- One-Off: No-include in all future comprehensive templates  

### Change 3
- Programmer: Jesse Coleman
- Date: 03/18/2025
- Change Description: Removed source() calls; all functions are included in the library adfgSubs.
- Template Update [Y|N]: Y
- One-Off: No-include in all future comprehensive templates 

### Change 4
- Programmer: Jesse Coleman
- Date: 05/21/2025
- Change Description: Refactor using tidyverse language and DRY ("don't repeat yourself") principles.
- Template Update [Y|N]: Y
- One-Off: No - include in all future comprehensive templates

## Input data
  
- {bootSampPath}/bootSamp_Employ.csv  
- {bootSampPath}/bootSamp_Person.csv  
- {bootSampPath}/bootSamp_HH.csv  
- /CSV/03 - Main/sample.csv

## Output data
  
- {bootSampPath}/REC23_FULL_CLEAN_BOOT.csv  
- /CSV/06 - HH Database Uploads/REC23_HH_FILE.csv

## Background

## Checklist
  
- Update 'Author' to your name  
- Update the project information in 'title' to the current project  
- Update the development log with any changes you've made to the template file, including your name 

## Additional information

*Note* for missing Income:  
- IF SIC/SOC are 0 (ie: No job), then earnings = 0.  
- IF SIC/SOC are < 0 (ie: Not employed), then schedule = 0.  
- Missing monthly earned income is replaced with **MEDIAN** as follows: First by SOC/SIC/schedule, then by SIC/SOC, then by SIC, finally, if still no non-zero income has been calculated, use the median of ANY job and use that value.

## Set up files for analysis  
  
Problem:  

- Each household has a minimum of 1 employment record  
- Each person in an employed household should have an employment record  

We need to merge the files such that all households, regardless of employment status have records for at least all reported individuals in the household. We then use logic to create a status for initially missing individuals based on known information (age and the `filterq` flag).

Some notes and enforced logic:  
- If a household lacks employment information AND person age information, all of this is removed and the HH is treated as unknown for employment completely.  
- Create an additional imputation step for later that will be used to account for people missing valid employment records altogether. 
- We assume that if no months worked has been checked that this value is just 'unknown'.


```{r set up files for analysis}

# List of all persons who had an employment record, not including those
#     with an implied person record of 0 - not employed
employPersonListData <- group_by(REC23Data, projID, samp, studyear, HHID, uHHID, strata, person) %>%
  summarize(personEmployRecord = n()) %>%
  filter(!is.na(person))

# Summary of household employment status (using filterq)
#
employHHListData <- group_by(REC23Data, projID, samp, studyear, HHID, uHHID, strata) %>%
  summarize(hhEmployRecord = max(filterq))

#     the employment page can be made. Also get total hhSize in this step.

## Missing data replacements

In this block of code, we will use mean replacement for 'employed adults' in the event a household has declined to share employment information. This is also applied to the number of 'months employed'. However, for earnings, the following rules are applied:  
  
- IF SIC/SOC are 0 (i.e., No job), then earnings = 0.  
- IF SIC/SOC are < 0 (i.e., Not employed), then schedule = 0.  
- Missing monthly earned income is replaced with **MEDIAN** as follows: First by SOC/SIC/schedule, then by SIC/SOC, then by SIC, finally, if still no non-zero income has been calculated, use the median of ANY job and use that value.   

```{r missing data replacements}

# Mean replace for JUST employed adults (standard functions won't work here, just use this).
#   Thinking about employment characteristics, always use the strata-level means,
#   we should not have an instance where the strata does not contain enough non-zero 
#   information to provide a mean.

  employData %>% 
  
  # Grouping variables; probably don't need `employedAdult` here because it is 
  #   handled in each mutate call. 
  group_by(projID, samp, studyear, communty, resource, strata, employedAdult) %>%
  
  # For rows with employed adults, calculate the mean number of months worked 
  #   per sample; otherwise NA
  mutate(mMean = if_else(employedAdult == 1, mean(monthsWorked, na.rm=TRUE), NA_real_), 
         monthsWorked = if_else(is.na(monthsWorked), mMean, monthsWorked),
         earnPerMonth = case_when(is.na(earnings/monthsWorked) & employedAdult == 0 ~ 0,
                                  is.na(earnings/monthsWorked) & employedAdult != 0 ~ NA_real_,
                                  TRUE ~ earnings/monthsWorked),
         earnings = if_else(employedAdult == 0 & is.na(earnings), 0, earnings),

## Impute missing-replaced data

This step calculates imputed information for income, number of jobs, number of employed adults for summarization in a later step. The means or 50th percentile of these summary results across 'samp' for a community represent the estimates for the community. This information is left at the re-sample level now so that confidence intervals can be calculated.

```{r impute MR data}

# Go to number of employed adults per-household | Employed and valid HHs
# Summarize to total employed adults per-household

# This computes the sum of people who reported 1 or more jobs combined with 
#    the number of households providing valid responses to 'jobs' question

## Econ file for HH database

This chunk prepares the person-level information necessary for the household database. Note that this uses reported information rather than the bootstrapped items. However, the imputed components of employment are also included so that analysis can be reliably reconstructed from this point, though confidence intervals would need to be resampled again as part of a bootstrapping process in order to re-create results. Those results may also differ (modestly) depending on the implementation of the uniform random function used.

```{r prep HH Database items}

imputedEconData <- employData %>%
  filter(samp == 0) %>%
  select(
    projID, studyear, communty, strata, HHID, person, jobnum, SOC, SIC, schedule, earnings,
    janWork, febWork, marWork, aprWork, mayWork, junWork, julWork, augWork, sepWork, octWork, novWork,
    decWork, earnings, imputedEarnings, monthsWorked, jtitle, employr
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    personID         = person,
    jobNum           = jobnum,
    reptEarnings     = earnings,
    imputedIncome    = imputedEarnings,
    jobName          = jtitle,
    Employer         = employr,
    numMonthsWorked  = monthsWorked
  ) %>%
  select(
    -person, -jobnum, -earnings, -imputedEarnings, -jtitle, -employr
  )

employData <- employData %>% 
  filter(employedAdult == 1)
