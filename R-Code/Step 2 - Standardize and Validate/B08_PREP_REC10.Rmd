## Background

Each harvest record type has been designed to contain the information relevant for a specific category of data. For example, record type 10 has been designed to contain harvest information for harvest of Large Land Mammals including feral large mammals. This record type typically involves month of harvest, sex, and the number of resources eaten or not eaten, depending on the design of the survey tool. The final product of this file is to ensure that REC10 is organized in such a way it can be combined with all other harvest record types and is properly configured for incorporation with the CSIS dataset.

## Load data

For this file, we are loading the raw data extract for record type 10 - Large Land Mammals.

```{r load data}

# Load data from intermediate files.
# ##############################################################################

# Load working data file.
REC10Data <- read.csv(str_interp('../../CSV/01 - Database Extract/REC10_raw.csv'), 
                      na = '', 
                      header = TRUE, 
                      strip.white = TRUE)
count = nrow(REC10Data)
cat(formatSummaryBlock(paste('Opened REC10_raw.csv, ', count, ' records loaded.', sep='')))

# Load lookup file(s) & Limit to essential data.

                         na = '', header = TRUE, 
                         strip.white = TRUE) %>%

                       strip.white = TRUE)
count <- nrow(sampleData)
cat(formatSummaryBlock(paste('Opened sample.csv, ', count, ' records loaded.', sep='')))

```

## Reduce file

The code chunk below (echoed for clarity), filters the record type 08 so only harvest records are included. When historical patterns or species-specific questions are asked separately from the main harvest and use section of the survey, they are sometimes stored in a 'sub-record' for REC10. This code should either:  
- Do nothing  
- Remove necessary rows  

```{r remove non-harvest records, echo=TRUE}

#REC10Data <- filter(REC10Data, subRecordCD == 0)

```

## Create lists for automation
In the section of code below, please review column names and ensure that all data columns from the data entry screen are present for this analysis project. If there are columns used in the data entry screen, but are not present here, they will need to be added. The harvAmtList vector needs to contain all of the harvest information columns. The recodeColList vector contains all of the columns that require recoding from the negative codes (-6, -7, -8 -9) to a standard missing code. The harvest amount columns need to be present in both of these vectors. 

<div class="todoBlock"> TO DO: Make sure months are properly specified below, that the number of resources used for food and for fur is stored in amtFoodFur or alternatively that amount used for fur only is stored in amtFoodFur. Also verify that sexNotAsked contains the list of resources where sex was not asked on the survey form. </div>

```{r create lists for automation}

# Recodes here, if necessary; example below recodes feral bison to bison.
#REC10Data$resource [REC10Data$resource == 230200000] = 210400000

# Use the standard mammal harvest columns.
harvAmtList <- standardMammalColumns

# amtFoodFur = 

# If food and fur wasn't asked, add it with a 0.
if(!("amtFoodFur" %in% colnames(REC10Data)))
{
  REC10Data$amtFoodFur = 0
  cat(warningMessage("Column amtFoodFur was added - verify that it was not named something else ie: amtFurOnly"))
}

# If sex wasn't asked, add it with a -6.
if(!("sex" %in% colnames(REC10Data)))
{
  REC10Data$sex = -6
  cat(warningMessage("Column sex was added - verify that this is accurate."))
}

# This line shouldn't require editing.
meanReplaceList = c(harvAmtList, "amtFoodFur")

# create a list of columns that can or will be used for analysis steps.
recodeColList <- c("used","attempt","harvestq","received","giveaway", "filterq", "usuallyq", "amtFoodFur", harvAmtList)

cat("<h4>Harvest columns:</h4>The following columns are listed as harvest columns that can be summed to get the total for a household")
cat(formatValueList(harvAmtList))

cat("<h4>Mean replace columns:</h4>The following columns are listed as amounts that will be evaluated for mean replacement:")
cat(formatValueList(meanReplaceList))

# Create a list of resources appearing on or added to the survey form where we did not ask about sex.
#   this list can be extended in a later step if required. If communities in the same project differ
#   we will assume sex was asked for all, but report communities where it's not as 'unknown sex'.

# If sex is NA, recode to -9 to assure automation is working properly.
REC10Data$sex[which(is.na(REC10Data$sex))] = -9

# If the only reported sex is a - code for a species, we can assume it belongs on the
#   sex not asked list.
sexData <- REC10Data %>% group_by(resource) %>%
  summarize(sex = max(sex, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  filter(sex < 0)

sexNotAskedList = sexData$resource 
sexNotAskedList = sexNotAskedList + 9

cat(warningMessage(str_interp("The following resources have been identified as not having 'sex' information: ${paste(sexNotAskedList, collapse=', ')}")))


```

### Verify column contents

If the data columns we require for analysis are not present, an error message will be returned. If we have the error message, display that to the screen and create an empty data frame that does contain all of the necessary records. Note that the REC10 data frame can have MORE columns than those listed as 'required'. In order for this file to work, all required columns must be present. To remedy this error, you must remove the missing column from the lists in the chunk of code displayed above (if it is not ever present) as well as from any subsequent code in this .Rmd file. Alternatively, you can add the missing column with default 0 values.


```{r verify record contents}

# Verify certain required columns are present.
verifyColList <- c("projID", "studyear", "communty", "HHID", "strata", recodeColList)

# Get a list of the missing columns
colList <- intersect(verifyColList, names(REC10Data))
colList <- verifyColList[!(verifyColList %in% colList)]

if(length(colList) > 0) {
  msgList = paste(colList, collapse=', ')
  cat(errorMessage(str_interp('Expected columns missing: ${msgList} <br> These will be added with 0 values; please verify this is accurate!')))
  
  REC10Data <- standardizeColumns(REC10Data, colList)
  
} else
{
  cat(greenMessage("REC10 successfully checked. All required columns are present."))
}

```

## Standardize coding

Evaluate columns of data used for development of tables and figures. Recode missing values to a single value for easier processing, rename columns as needed, and add missing community/resource records as needed. In this section the following steps take place:  
- Check for missing filterq data, report on results, standardize missing to -8 and recode harvest and use to -8 for all resources.  
- Recode all variables named in recodeColList to -8 if they are coded as any negative code.  
- For any resource added to any household that goes beyond the defaults on the printed survey, we need to add that to all other households. Note that the code allows us to retain certain key information, but it isn't required. By standardizing the resource list in this manner, summary statistics can be reliably computed using built-in R functions such as sd() and mean().  
- Recode variables to ensure proper handling of missing data. We interpret empty or missing data as 0 or NO. The reason for this is partially one of expediency in data processing, and also a matter of ensuring that when collected data is reviewed, it has been VERIFIED as some type of 'unknown' data.

## Merge sampling information.
After initial standardization, additional information can be added to each record for further processing.

```{r merge sampling}

cat(formatSummaryBlock('Sampling information merged.'))

```

## Convert to standard units

Before analysis can begin or missing data addressed, reported amounts of harvest need to be standardized for each resource so that summaries for each resource are dealing with comparable units. 

To convert from the amount in reported units, which may differ from those that will be reported in the CSIS and technical papers, the following math is used:  

$$x \times unit_d = (x \times {unit_r}) * \left(\frac{b \times pounds}{1 \times unit_r}\right) * \frac{1}{\frac{b \times pounds}{1 \times unit_d}}$$  
Where:  
- $x \times unit_d = $ Amount of resource in default units d,  
- $x \times unit_r = $ Amount of resource in reported units r,  
- $\left(\frac{b \times pounds}{1 \times unit_r}\right) = $ The number of pounds (b) per 1 reported unit $unit_r$  
- $\frac{b \times pounds}{1 \times unit_d} = $ The number of pounds (b) per 1 default unit $unit_d$  

Note that both $\left(\frac{b \times pounds}{1 \times unit_r}\right) = $ and $\frac{b \times pounds}{1 \times unit_d} = $ are determined in the conversion factor tables (convFact.csv) and, whenever possible, should be obtained from the conversion factor database within the SDS. 

This process described above is handled in a standardized function: standardizeConvFact found in the f_standardizeConversionFactors.r file.
  
Identification of reported resources and units of harvest as well as default units need to have occurred BEFORE this step of the analysis can be run. If convFact.csv has not yet been developed or substantial corrections have occurred to the data, the conversion factors will need to be evaluated. Please run B03_PREP_CONVERSION_FACTOR.Rmd.

The table of resource/units to be converted may include apparent 'duplicate' resource. This is because if a household indicated pounds of moose, for instance, then pounds of moose were added to all households in an earlier step. This table will show ALL rows that were added as well as any added to households because of non-standard units. De-duplication via aggregation occurs in a later step.

**Note** Non-standard units are uncommon with Large land mammals.

```{r standardize units}

# Show resources that require unit standardization.
stdData <- left_join(REC10Data, convFactData, by=c("projID", "studyear", "communty", "resource","units")) %>%
  filter(units != defaultUnits) 
print(knitr::kable(stdData,
                   caption=formatTableHeader("Harvest records with non-standard units.")))

# Standardize units using standard Subsistence Methods.
REC10StdData <- standardizeConvFact(REC10Data, convFactData, c(harvAmtList, "amtFoodFur"))

if(nrow(REC10StdData) == 0)
{
  cat(errorMessage(("Standardized conversion factors for REC10 produced no records - Have you remembered to update convFact.csv? - Records without standardized conversion factors will be used.")))
  
  REC10StdData <- REC10Data
  
} else {
  cat(formatSummaryBlock('Successfully Standardized units for all REC10 resource codes'))
}

```

## Conversion factors for unspecified resources
Resources are often reported as 'unspecified', in cases where the survey respondent
was unsure of the species harvested or received. To calculate the edible weight of 
unspecified resources harvested, similar resources and the amounts/weights harvested
are used to calculate the conversion factor for unspecified resources. Analysts must
develop a list of resources to use in this calculation for each unspecified resource.

```{r Calculate conversion factors for unspecified resources}

unspecTable <- REC10StdData %>% filter(str_detect(resName, "Unspecified") & harvestq == 1) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(commname, resource, resName) 

unspecTable %>% 
  kable(caption = 'Unspecified resources that were harvested',
        col.names = c('Community','Resource code','Resource name'),
        na = 'NA')

if (nrow(unspecTable) == 0) {
  cat(greenMessage("No unspecified resources were harvested."))
}

# The list of unspecified resources (resCalcConvFactList) and the group of resources from which the conversion factor will be calculated (resGroupConvFactList) must be modified for each project and record type. NOTE: given units and default units must be consistent among all resources used in the calculation!

# Example:

# resCalcConvFactList <- list(410499000, # Unspecified geese 
#                             421802990) # Unspecified grouses
# 
# resGroupConvFactList <- list(

## De-duplicate
Eliminate duplicates introduced when adding volunteered resources to the harvest record.

*NOTE* Please evaluate the code chunk below. Before finalizing this code and running analysis procedures, ensure that the columns below are a complete list of those that will be included in the final standardized file. Verify the following:

- Harvest rows are combined using sum() functions
- Binomial (yes/no) rows are combined using max() functions
- Key data used to identify unique household/resource/units (projID, studyear, HHID etc...) defind using group_by()
- Categorical information (ie: less/same/more) will be eliminated from this part of the processing. If that data exists per-species, a separate chunk starting with REC10_raw.csv should be written for processing.

*NOTE* If you receive a -InfWarning message regarding no missing arguments to max, you should have already received a message previously regarding missing data for the use/sharing questions. These are processed here.

```{r eliminate duplicates, message=FALSE}
# Eliminate duplicates.
REC10StdData <- group_by(REC10StdData, projID, studyear, communty, commname, commhh, 
                     samphh, sampPop, NHouseholds, strata, HHID, 
                     resource, units, sex, strataWt, commPop,

    # Apply sum() to these columns
    across(all_of(c(harvAmtList, "amtFoodFur")), 
           ~sum(., na.rm=TRUE)),
    # Ungroup to remove messages later
    .groups = "drop"

  str_interp('Removing duplicate rows. REC10 record count: ${count}')))

# Convert all Inf codes to NA.
REC10StdData <- inf_to_NA(REC10StdData, recodeColList)

```
## Process missing data

Prior to the development of harvest estimates, missing data must be properly handled. The Division of Subsistence standard relies on the following key assumptions:
- Missing data is sporadic, uniformly random, and free from discernible bias,
- Missing harvest data represents information believed to be consistent with the distribution of household harvests within the community as a whole.

From these assumptions, we extend the theorem that the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean (Cochran 1977) to resolve most instances of missing harvest data. Thus, a mean is calculated by gear-type, sex, month, location and/or age class and subsequently applied to all instances where some harvest was indicated but amounts not provided.

In the event that a single household indicated harvest of a resource, but did not provide an amount, we assume a 'minimum' replacement value of the strata or community minimum (for a simple random sample, these are the same). This is based on the assumption that the household DID harvest something, and therefore we know zero is not appropriate. Any value other value is speculation and must be justified. The minimum value is applied as the only reasonable replacement because we are assuming that the harvest was nonzero.

*NOTE* for the table below, verify that the total mean replaced harvest _MR is consistent with the sum of harvest amounts. Also verify that mean replacements (typically small amounts with decimal points) seem to make sense. Only rows with harvests are displayed.

<div class="todoBlock">Revise the mean replacement code if months are not used.</div>

## Estimated pounds

Now that mean replacements have occurred, a mean-replaced amount column will be calculated for use with an imputed estimated column. Computation of pounds harvested is also made at this time. In the table below, verify that the reported and mean replaced pounds appear to be correct and that all amounts are expanded. Only records with harvests are shown.

Amount not eaten is also calculated at this time and worked into the estimates of harvest.If amtFoodFur was mean replaced it is almost certain to have a decimal point. That is checked by seeing if amtFoodFur has a decimal point. If it does, then we can't use that to calculate pounds for reported lbs & CI calculation because we don't actually know how much was eaten and it's mean replaced.

```{r calculate pounds harvested}

# There may be resources not eaten. 

# Recode amtFoodFur to ALL eaten (or none because 0) when -6
REC10StdData$amtFoodFur[REC10StdData$amtFoodFur == -6] = REC10StdData$harvestAmt_MR[REC10StdData$amtFoodFur == -6]

# Calculate amtFoodFur for use in later filed.
REC10StdData$amtFurOnly = REC10StdData$harvestAmt_MR - REC10StdData$amtFoodFur

# If we somehow have more amtFoodFur than we have harvest amount, then we make them the same
#  and just assume all were eaten.

REC10StdData <- REC10StdData %>%
  mutate(
    amtFoodFur = case_when(
      amtFurOnly < 0 & !is.na(amtFurOnly) ~ harvestAmt_MR,
      TRUE ~ amtFoodFur
    ),
    amtFurOnly = case_when(
      amtFurOnly < 0 & !is.na(amtFurOnly) ~ 0,
      TRUE ~ amtFurOnly
    )
  )

# Create an amtEaten column
REC10StdData$reptEaten = REC10StdData$amtFoodFur

# Try to work out if we have a decimal point. I've been generous and assumed anything with a .00001 is 
#   0, we could probably get away with 001; this is done because floating point precision sometimes 
#   leaves us with long and virtually empty decimal places.
REC10StdData$checkFur = floor(REC10StdData$amtFoodFur) - REC10StdData$amtFoodFur

# Basically 0; Make reptEaten == NA for the purposes of calculating a CI.
REC10StdData$reptEaten[REC10StdData$checkFur > .00001] = NA

# Pounds harvested; reported eaten and mean-replaced eaten.
REC10StdData$reptHarvestLbs = REC10StdData$reptEaten * REC10StdData$convFact 
REC10StdData$harvestLbs_MR = REC10StdData$amtFoodFur * REC10StdData$convFact 

# Pounds harvested table for review.
tempData <- select(REC10StdData, commname, resource, units, reptHarvestAmt, 
                   reptHarvestLbs, harvestAmt_MR, harvestLbs_MR, amtFurOnly) %>%
    filter(harvestAmt_MR > 0) %>%
    arrange(desc(harvestLbs_MR))
knitr::kable(tempData,
             caption=formatTableHeader("Reported harvest Amount & Pounds"),
             align="l")

```


## Enforce logic rules

Note that for large game, because of the level of detail we ask, that additional columns of data are added AFTER CSIS formatting. We will enforce logic rules first.

```{r insert missing and derived columns}


# 3.1 Enforce logic rules.

# 3.1.1 If a harvest amount is specified, ensure harvestq = 1
REC10StdData$harvestq[REC10StdData$harvestAmt_MR > 0] = 1

# 3.1.2 If harvest occurred, then an attempt did as well.
REC10StdData$attempt[REC10StdData$harvestq == 1] = 1

# 3.1.3 If any was harvested or given away, then we count it as used.
REC10StdData$used[REC10StdData$received == 1 | REC10StdData$harvestq == 1] = 1

# 3.1.4 If an amount was reported as given away, but none harvested or 
#       received, we assume it came from a previous year
REC10StdData$giveaway[REC10StdData$received == 0 & REC10StdData$harvestq == 0] = 0

# 3.2 Speclist set == 2 where sex WAS asked ONLY.
REC10StdData$specList = 2
#REC10StdData$specList[which(REC10StdData$sex == -6)] = 1
#REC10StdData$specList[which(REC10StdData$sex != -6)] = 2

```

## Create rows for CSIS aggregation.

Subsistence large land mammal harvests are recorded with the detail digit of 0 in the resource code. For the CSIS, harvests are separated by sex for select species. Here we would add a 1 for male, 2 for female, or 9 for unspecified. For integration with CSIS and ensuring that species are properly combined with commercially retained resources, harvests records are duplicated and resources aggregated to the species level (from detail sex) to ensure accurate totals.

```{r CSIS rows}

count <- nrow(REC10StdData)

# 4.1 Duplicate the file
REC10SubsDataTemp <- REC10StdData


# 4.2 Recode resource to the species level: divide resource code by 10 then multiply by 10
REC10SubsDataTemp$resource=trunc(REC10SubsDataTemp$resource / 10) * 10

# 4.3 Recode sex to -6 at the species level
REC10SubsDataTemp <- REC10SubsDataTemp %>% 
  mutate(sex = case_when(is.na(sex) | sex %in% c(1,2,9,-8,-9) ~ -6,
                         TRUE ~ sex))
                         
REC10SubsDataTemp$specList = 1

# 4.5 Group by and Summarize HHID and species
REC10SubsDataTemp <- group_by(REC10SubsDataTemp, projID, studyear, communty, commname, strata, HHID, resName, resource, units, specList, convFact, sex, commhh, samphh, sampPop, commPop, strataWt, NHouseholds, NPopulation) %>%
  summarize(across(c(filterq,usuallyq,used,attempt,harvestq,giveaway,received),
                   ~max(., na.rm = TRUE)),
            across(all_of(c(harvAmtList, "amtFurOnly", "harvestAmt_MR", "reptHarvestAmt", "harvestLbs_MR", "reptHarvestLbs")),
                          ~sum(., na.rm = TRUE))
  )

# Merge and sort
REC10CSISData <- bind_rows(REC10StdData, REC10SubsDataTemp, .id = NULL) %>%
   arrange(projID, studyear, communty, commname, strata, HHID, resName, resource)

# Recode amtFurOnly back to -6 as needed 
REC10CSISData$amtFurOnly[is.na(REC10CSISData$amtFurOnly)]=-6

# 4.8 Delete rows for resource codes where we didn't ask about sex
#REC10CSISData <- filter(REC10CSISData, !(resource %in% sexNotAskedList))

# 4.9 Final clean-up: recode NaN and inf to NA.
REC10CSISData <- inf_to_NA(REC10CSISData, c("used","attempt", "received", "harvestq", "giveaway"))
REC10CSISData <- nan_to_NA(REC10CSISData, c("used","attempt", "received", "harvestq", "giveaway"))
