## Input data 
  
- /CSV/01 - Database Extract/REC03_raw.csv  
- /CSV/03 - Main/convFact.csv  
- /CSV/03 - Main/sample.csv  

*NOTE* Record type files MUST contain, at a minimum, the following: "projID", "studyear", "communty", "strata", "resource", "units". Conversion factor file (convFact.csv), MUST contain, at a minimum, the  following: "projID", "studyear", "communty", "resource", "units", "convFact","defaultUnits".  

## Output data
  
- /CSV/03 - main/REC03_CSIS_ORG_clean.csv  

## Background

Each harvest record type has been designed to contain the information relevant for a specific category of data. For example, record type 03 (03a, 03b, 03c historically) has been designed to contain harvest information for personal retention of resources (homepack) taken during commercial fishing activities. The final product of this file is to ensure that REC03 is organized in such a way it can be combined with all other harvest record types and is properly configured for incorporation with the CSIS dataset.

## Checklist

- Update 'Author' to your name   
- Update the project information in 'title' to the current project  
- Update the development log with any changes you've made to the template file, including your name  
- Revise gear types to match those used for this project  
- Convert units to defaults  
- Add missing resources to households  
- Missing data replacement  
- Add missing columns  
- Organize into CSIS format  

## Additional information

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE UPDATED convFact.csv PRIOR to running this script.

If your script successfully loads REC03, but all of the records disappear, it is likely that you have failed to properly update the conversion factors for 'standardize conversion factors'.

## Load data

For this file, we are loading the raw data extract for record type 03 - Commercial retention.

```{r load data}

# ##############################################################################
# Load data from intermediate files.
# ##############################################################################

# Load working data file.
REC03Data <- read.csv(str_interp('../../CSV/01 - Database Extract/REC03_raw.csv'),

                      header = TRUE, 
                      strip.white = TRUE)

                         na = '', header = TRUE, 
                         strip.white = TRUE) %>%
  select(projID, studyear, communty, resName, resource, units, convFact, lbsToDefault, defaultUnits)
count <- nrow(convFactData)
cat(formatSummaryBlock(paste('Opened convFact.csv, ', count, ' records loaded.', sep='')))

# Load sample data

                       strip.white = TRUE)
count <- nrow(sampleData)
cat(formatSummaryBlock(paste('Opened sample.csv, ', count, ' records loaded.', sep='')))

```

## Create lists for automation
In the section of code below, please review column names and ensure that all data columns from the data entry screen are present for this analysis project. If there are columns used in the data entry screen, but are not present here, they will need to be added. The harvAmtList vector needs to contain all of the harvest information columns. The recodeColList vector contains all of the columns that require recoding from the negative codes (-6, -7, -8 -9) to a standard missing code. The harvest amount columns need to be present in both of these vectors. 


```{r create lists for automation}

# Harvest amount columns - to be used for operations that work across 
#     columns. These are set at the beginning to simplify updates.
harvAmtList <- c("removeOwnUse", "amtGavetoCrew", "amtGaveOthers")

# create a list of columns that can or will be used for analysis steps.
recodeColList <- c("commFishYN", "keepResourceYN", "incidentalYN", "removeOwnUse", 
                   "amtGavetoCrew", "amtGaveOthers", "filterq", "usuallyq")

```

## Verify column contents

If the data columns we require for analysis are not present, an error message will be returned. If we have the error message, display that to the screen and create an empty data frame that does contain all of the necessary records. Note that the REC03 data frame can have MORE columns than those listed as 'required'. In order for this file to work, all required columns must be present. To remedy this error, you must remove the missing column from the lists in the chunk of code displayed above (if it is not ever present) as well as from any subsequent code in this .Rmd file. Alternatively, you can add the missing column with default 0 values.

```{r verify record contents}

# Verify essential columns are present.
verifyColList <- c("projID", "studyear", "communty", "HHID", "strata", recodeColList)

# Get a list of the missing columns
colList <- intersect(verifyColList, names(REC03Data))
colList <- verifyColList[!(verifyColList %in% colList)]

if(length(colList) > 0) {
  msgList = paste(colList, collapse=', ')
  cat(errorMessage(str_interp('Expected columns missing: ${msgList} <br> These will be added with 0 values; please verify this is accurate!')))
  
  REC03Data <- standardizeColumns(REC03Data, colList)
  
} else
{
  cat(greenMessage("REC03 successfully checked. All required columns are present."))
}

```
## Insert missing columns & derived columns

The commercial fishing record does not have the standard 'use' columns of used, attempt, harvestq, recieved, giveaway. These are added with appropriate values based on responses to removed for own use, gave to crew and gave to others. Further, the standardized list of harvest columns and necessary columns for the household database are added here to ensure consistent processing later in the analysis.

```{r insert missing and derived columns}

                            
# Number of columns.
count = length(REC03Data)

REC03Data <- REC03Data %>%
  # Create any required columns with default values
  mutate(
    harvestq = 0,
    attempt = 0, 
    giveaway = 0,
    received = 0,
    used = 0,
    displayGroup = 0
  ) %>%
  # Use across() to update multiple columns at once
  mutate(
    # Set harvestq, attempt, and used to 1 when keep, incidental, or remove != 0
    across(c(harvestq, attempt, used), 
           ~ case_when(
             if_any(c(keepResourceYN, incidentalYN, removeOwnUse), ~ . != 0) ~ 1,
             TRUE ~ .
           )
    ),
    # Handle giveaway separately because it has a different condition
    giveaway = case_when(
      amtGavetoCrew > 0 ~ 1,
      amtGaveOthers > 0 ~ 1,
      TRUE ~ giveaway
    )
  )
```

## Standardize coding

Evaluate columns of data used for development of tables and figures. Recode missing values to a single value for easier processing, rename columns as needed, and add missing community/resource records as needed. In this section the following steps take place:
- Check for missing filterq data, report on results, standardize missing to -8 and recode harvest and use to -8 for all resources.  
- Recode all variables named in recodeColList to -8 if they are coded as any negative code.  
- For any resource added to any household that goes beyond the defaults on the printed survey, we need to add that to all other households. Note that the code allows us to retain certain key information, but it isn't required. By standardizing the resource list in this manner, summary statistics can be reliably computed using built-in R functions such as sd() and mean().  
- Recode variables to ensure proper handling of missing data. We interpret empty or missing data as 0 or NO. The reason for this is partially one of expediency in data processing, and also a matter of ensuring that when collected data is reviewed, it has been VERIFIED as some type of 'unknown' data.

cat(formatSummaryBlock('Sampling information merged.'))

```

## Convert to standard units

Before analysis can begin or missing data addressed, reported amounts of harvest need to be standardized for each resource so that summaries for each resource are dealing with comparable units. 

To convert from the amount in reported units, which may differ from those that will be reported in the CSIS and technical papers, the following math is used:  

$$x \times unit_d = (x \times {unit_r}) * \left(\frac{b \times pounds}{1 \times unit_r}\right) * \frac{1}{\frac{b \times pounds}{1 \times unit_d}}$$  
Where:  
- $x \times unit_d = $ Amount of resource in default units d,  
- $x \times unit_r = $ Amount of resource in reported units r,  
- $\left(\frac{b \times pounds}{1 \times unit_r}\right) = $ The number of pounds (b) per 1 reported unit $unit_r$  
- $\frac{b \times pounds}{1 \times unit_d} = $ The number of pounds (b) per 1 default unit $unit_d$  

Note that both $\left(\frac{b \times pounds}{1 \times unit_r}\right) = $ and $\frac{b \times pounds}{1 \times unit_d} = $ are determined in the conversion factor tables (convFact.csv) and, whenever possible, should be obtained from the conversion factor database within the SDS. 

This process described above is handled in a standardized function: standardizeConvFact found in the f_standardizeConversionFactors.r file.
  
Identification of reported resources and units of harvest as well as default units need to have occurred BEFORE this step of the analysis can be run. If convFact.csv has not yet been developed or substantial corrections have occurred to the data, the conversion factors will need to be evaluated. Please run B03_PREP_CONVERSION_FACTOR.Rmd.

The table of resource/units to be converted may include apparent 'duplicate' resource. This is because if a household indicated pounds of Chinook salmon, for instance, then pounds of Chinook salmon were added to all households in an earlier step. This table will show ALL rows that were added as well as any added to households because of non-standard units. De-duplication via aggregation occurs in a later step.

```{r standardize units}

# Show resources that require unit standardization.
stdData <- left_join(REC03Data, convFactData, by=c("projID", "studyear", "communty", "resource","units")) %>%
  filter(units != defaultUnits) 

print(knitr::kable(stdData,
                   caption=formatTableHeader("Harvest records with non-standard units.")))

# Standardize units using standard Subsistence Methods.
REC03StdData <- standardizeConvFact(REC03Data, convFactData, harvAmtList)


if(nrow(REC03StdData) == 0)
{
  cat(errorMessage(("REC03 has no records - Have you remembered to update convFact.csv? - Records without standardized conversion factors will be used.")))

  REC03StdData <- REC03Data

} else {
  cat(formatSummaryBlock('Successfully Standardized units for all REC03 resource codes'))
}


```

## Conversion factors for unspecified resources
Resources are often reported as 'unspecified', in cases where the survey respondent
was unsure of the species harvested or received. To calculate the edible weight of 
unspecified resources harvested, similar resources and the amounts/weights harvested
are used to calculate the conversion factor for unspecified resources. Analysts must
develop a list of resources to use in this calculation for each unspecified resource.

```{r Calculate conversion factors for unspecified resources}

unspecTable <- REC03StdData %>% filter(is.na(convFact) & harvestq == 1) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(commname, resource, resName) 

unspecTable %>% 
  kable(caption = 'Unspecified resources that were harvested',
        col.names = c('Community','Resource code','Resource name'),
        na = 'NA')

if (nrow(unspecTable) == 0) {
  cat(greenMessage("No unspecified resources were harvested."))
}

# The list of unspecified resources (resCalcConvFactList) and the group of resources from which the conversion factor will be calculated (resGroupConvFactList) must be modified for each project and record type. NOTE: given units and default units must be consistent among all resources used in the calculation!

# Example:

# resCalcConvFactList <- list(410499000, # Unspecified geese 
#                             421802990) # Unspecified grouses
# 
# resGroupConvFactList <- list(
#   c(410406000, 410408000, 410410000, 410404990), # Other types of geese harvested
#   c(421802020, 421802060, 421802040) # Other types of grouse harvested
# )

resCalcConvFactList <- list(numeric(0)) # Unspecified resource

resGroupConvFactList <- list(numeric(0)) # Other types harvested

calcConvFactData <- map2_dfr(
  resCalcConvFactList,
  resGroupConvFactList,
  function(resCalcConvFact, resGroupConvFact) {
    REC03StdData %>%
      filter(resource %in% resGroupConvFact) %>%
      rowwise() %>%
      mutate(
        reptHarvestAmt = sum(across(all_of(harvAmtList)), na.rm = TRUE),
        reptHarvestLbs = reptHarvestAmt * convFact
      ) %>%
      filter(reptHarvestAmt > 0) %>%
      group_by(communty) %>%
      summarize(convFact = sum(reptHarvestLbs) / sum(reptHarvestAmt)) %>%
      mutate(
        lbsToDefault = 1 / convFact,
        resource = resCalcConvFact,
        source = 'Calculated'
      ) %>%
      left_join(convFactData, by = c('communty', 'resource'))  %>% 
      select(
        projID, studyear, communty, resName, resource, units, convFact.x, lbsToDefault.x, defaultUnits, source
      ) %>%
      rename(
        convFact = convFact.x,
        lbsToDefault = lbsToDefault.x
      ) %>%
      mutate(convFact = case_when(units == 2 & defaultUnits == 1 ~ 1,
                             TRUE ~ convFact))
  }
)

  kable(calcConvFactData,
        caption = 'Unspecified resource conversion factors')
  
cat(warningMessage("Double-check conversion factors, default units, and lbsToDefault"))
    
convFactData <- convFactData %>%
  filter(!resource %in% unlist(resCalcConvFactList)) %>%
  bind_rows(calcConvFactData) %>%
  arrange(resource)

```


## De-duplicate
Eliminate duplicates introduced when adding volunteered resources to the harvest record.

*NOTE* Please evaluate the code chunk below. Before finalizing this code and running analysis procedures, ensure that the columns below are a complete list of those that will be included in the final standardized file. Verify the following:

- Harvest rows are combined using sum() functions
- Binomial (yes/no) rows are combined using max() functions
- Key data used to identify unique household/resource/units (projID, studyear, HHID etc...) defind using group_by()
- Categorical information (ie: less/same/more) will be eliminated from this part of the processing. If that data exists per-species, a separate chunk starting with REC03_raw.csv should be written for processing.

*NOTE* If you receive a -InfWarning message regarding no missing arguments to max, you should have already received a message previously regarding missing data for the use/sharing questions. These are processed here.

```{r eliminate duplicates, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}

# Eliminate duplicates.

REC03StdData <- REC03StdData %>% 
  group_by(projID, studyear, communty, commname, commhh, 
           samphh, sampPop, NHouseholds, strata, HHID, 
           resource, units, strataWt, commPop,
           NPopulation) %>%
  summarize(
    # Apply max() to these columns
    across(c(filterq, usuallyq, harvestq, commFishYN, keepResourceYN, incidentalYN), 
           ~max(., na.rm = TRUE)),
    # Apply sum() to these columns
    across(c(removeOwnUse, amtGavetoCrew, amtGaveOthers), 
           ~sum(., na.rm = TRUE)),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

count <- nrow(REC03StdData)

cat(formatSummaryBlock(
  str_interp('Removing duplicate rows. REC03 record count: ${count}')))

# Convert all Inf codes to NA.
REC03StdData <- inf_to_NA(REC03StdData, recodeColList)

```

## Process missing data

Prior to the development of harvest estimates, missing data must be properly handled. The Division of Subsistence standard relies on the following key assumptions:
- Missing data is sporadic, uniformly random, and free from discernible bias,
- Missing harvest data represents information believed to be consistent with the distribution of household harvests within the community as a whole.

From these assumptions, we extend the theorem that the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean (Cochran 1977) to resolve most instances of missing harvest data. Thus, a mean is calculated by gear-type, sex, month, location and/or age class and subsequently applied to all instances where some harvest was indicated but amounts not provided.

In the event that a single household indicated harvest of a resource, but did not provide an amount, we assume a 'minimum' replacement value of the strata or community minimum (for a simple random sample, these are the same). This is based on the assumption that the household DID harvest something, and therefore we know zero is not appropriate. Any value other value is speculation and must be justified. The minimum value is applied as the only reasonable replacement because we are assuming that the harvest was nonzero.

*NOTE* for the table below, verify that the total mean replaced harvest _MR is consistent with the sum of harvest amounts. Also verify that mean replacements (typically small amounts with decimal points) seem to make sense. Only rows with harvests are displayed.

```{r missing replacement, message = FALSE}


# Compute reported harvest amount.
REC03StdData <- rowwise(REC03StdData) %>% 
             mutate(reptHarvestAmt = sum(across(all_of(harvAmtList))))

# Mean replacements
REC03StdData <- dfMeanReplaceStratified(REC03StdData, replCols = harvAmtList, checkCol = "harvestq")

# Calculate mean replaced total harvest.
REC03StdData <- rowwise(REC03StdData) %>% 
  mutate(harvestAmt_MR = sum(across(all_of(harvAmtList))),
         # Mean replaced data flag.
         mRepl = if_else(is.na(reptHarvestAmt) & harvestAmt_MR > 0, 1 ,0))

tRec <- nrow(REC03StdData)
count <- sum(REC03StdData$mRepl)

if(count == 0) {
  cat(greenMessage(("There were NO missing-value replacements for harvests at the resource-code level.")))
} 
if(count / tRec > 0 &
   count / tRec < 0.07) {
  cat(warningMessage("Fewer than 7% of resource harvest records were marked as missing, refused, not asked, or unknown."))
  cat(warningMessage(paste(count, " records were replaced with the mean or minimum values.", sep='')))
} 
if(count / tRec >= 0.07) {
  cat(errorMessage(("More than 7% of resource harvest records were marked as missing, refused, not asked, or unknown. Please review surveys to ensure that no systematic or administration errors are present before continuing.")))
  cat(warningMessage(paste(count, " records were replaced with the mean or minimum values.", sep='')))
} 

# Mean replaced table for review.
tempData <- select(REC03StdData, commname, resource, HHID, mRepl, 
                   !!!syms(harvAmtList), 
                   harvestAmt_MR, units) %>%
    filter(harvestAmt_MR > 0) %>%
    arrange(desc(mRepl), desc(harvestAmt_MR))
knitr::kable(tempData,
             caption=formatTableHeader("Detail columns with mean replacements"),
             align="l")

```

## Estimated pounds

Now that mean replacements have occurred, a mean-replaced amount column will be calculated for use with an imputed estimated column. Computation of pounds harvested is also made at this time. In the table below, verify that the reported and mean replaced pounds appear to be correct and that all amounts are expanded. Only records with harvests are shown.

```{r harvest total columns, eval = TRUE}

# Bring back in conversion factors.
REC03StdData <- select(convFactData, projID, studyear, communty, resName, resource, units, convFact) %>%
  right_join(REC03StdData, by=c("projID", "studyear", "communty", "resource", "units")) %>%
  # Pounds harvested
  mutate(reptHarvestLbs = reptHarvestAmt * convFact,
         harvestLbs_MR = harvestAmt_MR * convFact)

# Pounds harvested table for review.
tempData <- select(REC03StdData, commname, resource, units, reptHarvestAmt, 
                   reptHarvestLbs, harvestAmt_MR, harvestLbs_MR) %>%
    filter(harvestAmt_MR > 0) %>%
    arrange(desc(harvestLbs_MR))
knitr::kable(tempData,
             caption=formatTableHeader("Reported harvest Amount & Pounds"),
             align="l")


```

## Create rows for CSIS aggregation.

Commercial harvests are recorded with the detail digit of 1 at the end of each commercially retained species. For integration with CSIS and ensuring that species are properly combined when subsistence, personal use, and rod and reel harvests, a second duplicate row with no detail digit and specList = 1 column will be created.

```{r create rows for CSIS aggregation, eval = TRUE}

# Add all of the other columns that we don't already have, but won't be filled with values.
REC03StdData <- standardizeColumns(REC03StdData, fullHarvColList) %>% 
  mutate(specList = 2)

count = length(REC03StdData) - count

cat(formatSummaryBlock(
  str_interp('${count} columns have been added to REC03.')))

count = nrow(REC03StdData)

# Duplicate working data file
REC03CSISData <- REC03StdData %>% 
  
  # Set to aggregate level (in this case the individual species level.)
  mutate(specList = 1,
         resource = trunc(resource/10)*10,
         resName = str_remove(resName, pattern = " \\[CF retention\\]")) %>% 

  # Merge and sort.
  bind_rows(REC03StdData) %>% 
  arrange(projID, studyear, communty, strata, HHID, resource)

# Final clean-up: recode nan and inf to NA - shouldn't be necessary for REC03.
#REC03CSISData <- inf_to_NA(REC03CSISData, c("used","attempt", "received", "harvestq", "giveaway"))
#REC03CSISData <- nan_to_NA(REC03CSISData, c("used","attempt", "received", "harvestq", "giveaway"))

cat(formatSummaryBlock(
  str_interp('${count} rows have been added to REC03.')))

```
