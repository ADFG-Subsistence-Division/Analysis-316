# Prep REC04

Organize and standardize REC04 salmon in order to merge with all other harvest record types in a later step.

## Changelog

### Change 1
- Programmer: D.S.Koster  
- Date: 04/18/2024  
- Change Description: Updated organization and formatting to be more consistent and provide better feedback/output. Additional updates were made to allow knit to go forward and provide meaningful output rather than failing to knit with cryptic errors. Substantial automation has been implemented. TODO statements and red error boxes describe changes required per project.   
- Template Update [Y|N]: Y  
- One-Off: No-include in all future comprehensive templates 

### Change 2
- Programmer: Jesse Coleman
- Date: 03/18/2025
- Change Description: Removed source() calls; all functions are included in the library adfgSubs.
- Template Update [Y|N]: Y
- One-Off: No-include in all future comprehensive templates 

### Change 3
- Programmer: Jesse Coleman
- Date: 04/23/2025
- Change Description: Refactor using tidyverse language and DRY ("don't repeat yourself") principles.

## Input data 
  
- /CSV/01 - Database Extract/REC04_raw.csv  
- /CSV/03 - Main/convFact.csv  
- /CSV/00 - Lookup Codes/projectCodeSets.csv  
- /CSV/03 - Main/sample.csv  

*NOTE* Record type files MUST contain, at a minimum, the following: "projID", "studyear", "communty", "strata", "resource", "units". Conversion factor file (convFact.csv), MUST contain, at a minimum, the  following: "projID", "studyear", "communty", "resource", "units", "convFact","defaultUnits".  

## Output data
  
- /CSV/03 - main/REC04_CSIS_ORG_clean.csv

Lists from Z00_PROJECT_PARAMETERS.r, fullHarvColList

## Background

Each harvest record type has been designed to contain the information relevant for a specific category of data. For example, record type 04 has been designed to contain harvest information for salmon, which typically includes gear types along with use and sharing information per species, and sometimes location of harvest. The final product of this file is to ensure that REC04 is organized in such a way it can be combined with all other harvest record types and is properly configured for incorporation with the CSIS dataset.


## Checklist

- Update 'Author' to your name  
- Update the project information in 'title' to the current project  
- Update the development log with any changes you've made to the template file, including your name  
- Convert units to defaults  
- Add missing resources to households  
- Missing data replacement  
- Add missing columns  
- Organize into CSIS format (Rod & Reel, Subsistence & species total row)

## Additional Information

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE UPDATED convFact.csv PRIOR to running this script.

If your script successfully loads REC03, but all of the records disappear, it is likely that you have failed to properly update the conversion factors for 'standardize conversion factors'.

```

## Load data

For this file, we are loading the raw data extract for record type 04 - salmon harvests.

```{r load data}

# Load data from intermediate files.
# ##############################################################################

# Load working data file.
REC04Data <- read.csv(str_interp('../../CSV/01 - Database Extract/REC04_raw.csv'), 
                      na = '', 
                      header = TRUE, 
                      strip.white = TRUE)
count = nrow(REC04Data)
cat(formatSummaryBlock(paste('Opened REC04_raw.csv, ', count, ' records loaded.', sep='')))

# Load lookup file(s) & Limit to essential data.
convFactData <- read.csv('../../CSV/03 - Main/convFact.csv', 
                         na = '', header = TRUE, 
                         strip.white = TRUE) %>%
  select(projID, studyear, communty, resName, resource, units, convFact, lbsToDefault, defaultUnits)
count <- nrow(convFactData)
cat(formatSummaryBlock(paste('Opened convFact.csv, ', count, ' records loaded.', sep='')))

gearTypeCodes <- read.csv('../../CSV/00 - Lookup Codes/projectCodeSets.csv') %>%
  filter(codeSetID == 54) %>%
  rename(othGearCD1 = code,
         othGearName1 = codeDescription) %>% 
  select(othGearCD1, othGearName1)

# Load sample data
sampleData <- read.csv(str_interp('../../CSV/03 - Main/sample.csv'), 
                       na = '', 
                       header = TRUE, 
                       strip.white = TRUE)
count <- nrow(sampleData)
cat(formatSummaryBlock(paste('Opened sample.csv, ', count, ' records loaded.', sep='')))

```

## Reduce file

The code chunk below (echoed for clarity), filters the record type 04 so only harvest records are included. When historical patterns or species-specific questions are asked separately from the main harvest and use section of the survey, they are sometimes stored in a 'sub-record' for REC04. This code should either:  
- Do nothing  
- Remove necessary rows  

```{r remove non-harvest records, echo=TRUE}

REC04Data <- filter(REC04Data, subRecordCD == 0)

```

## Create lists for automation
In the section of code below, please review column names and ensure that all data columns from the data entry screen are present for this analysis project. If there are columns used in the data entry screen, but are not present here, they will need to be added. The harvAmtList vector needs to contain all of the harvest information columns. The recodeColList vector contains all of the columns that require recoding from the negative codes (-6, -7, -8 -9) to a standard missing code. The harvest amount columns need to be present in both of these vectors. 

## Initalize columns for otherGearCD1

## Manually pivot 'Other' gear

<div class="todoBlock"> Add gear type column name and numeric code for each additional gear type specified in the table above. </div>

```{r initialize other gear}

# Define mapping of othGearCD1 codes to new column names. Each list item should follow the convention: [new gear type column name] = [two-digit gear type code]. Separate list items with commas.
gear_mapping <- list(
  amtTrolling = 19
  # Add more mappings as needed
)

REC04Data <- REC04Data %>%
  # Replace NA with 0 in othGearCD1
  mutate(othGearCD1 = case_when(
    is.na(othGearCD1) ~ 0,
    TRUE ~ othGearCD1
  )) %>%
  # Initialize all new columns with zeros (fixed approach)
  mutate(!!!setNames(rep(list(0), length(gear_mapping)), names(gear_mapping))) %>%
  # For each mapping, update the corresponding column
  mutate(across(
    names(gear_mapping),
    ~ case_when(
      othGearCD1 == gear_mapping[[cur_column()]] ~ amtOtherGear,
      TRUE ~ .
    )
  )) %>%
  # Set amtOtherGear to 0 when othGearCD1 matches any gear code
  mutate(
    amtOtherGear = case_when(
      othGearCD1 %in% unlist(gear_mapping) ~ 0,
      TRUE ~ amtOtherGear
    ),
    # Replace all processed codes with NA in othGearCD1
    othGearCD1 = case_when(
      othGearCD1 %in% unlist(gear_mapping) ~ NA_real_,
      othGearCD1 == 0 ~ NA_real_,
      TRUE ~ othGearCD1
    )
  )
```

## Set gear types

Review the following outputs carefully. This file attempts to automatically identify harvest columns and incorporate those into the analysis. It is not assured to work.

```{r create lists for automation}

cat("<h4>REC04 contains the following columns:</h4>")
cat(formatValueList(names(REC04Data)))
#cat(str_interp("REC04 contains the following columns: <br><br> ${paste(names(REC04Data), collapse=', ')} <br><br> verify."))

# Harvest amount columns -
#  Dynamically add harvest columns
harvAmtList <- intersect(names(REC04Data), standardGearColumns)

cat("<h4>Found gear types:</h4>")
cat(formatValueList(harvAmtList))

salmonGearData <- data.frame(harvAmtList)

# Write out lookup for salmon gear types.
  fName = str_interp('../../CSV/00 - Lookup Codes/salmonGear.csv')
  cat(formatSummaryBlock(
    paste('Writing file: ', fName, 
          ' ', nrow(salmonGearData), ' records to be written', sep='')))

rio::export(salmonGearData, fName)

# Dynamically locate dog food or any other column that might be needed.
otherAmtList <- intersect(standardFishOtherColumns, names(REC04Data))

# Values that will be mean replaced.
meanReplaceList <- c(harvAmtList, otherAmtList)
recodeColList <- c("used","attempt","harvestq","received","giveaway", "filterq", "usuallyq", otherAmtList, harvAmtList)

# Message confirming dynamic harvest column identification.
if(length(harvAmtList) == 1) {
  cat(errorMessage(str_interp("Only one gear type code has been specified for salmon; Have you added all gear types included in REC04? Please review valid column names: ${names(REC04Data)}")))
} else {
  cat(greenMessage(str_interp("${length(harvAmtList)} gear type columns have been identified.")))
}

```

## Verify column contents

If the data columns we require for analysis are not present, an error message will be returned. If we have the error message, display that to the screen and create an empty data frame that does contain all of the necessary records. Note that the REC04 data frame can have MORE columns than those listed as 'required'. In order for this file to work, all required columns must be present. To remedy this error, you must remove the missing column from the lists in the chunk of code displayed above (if it is not ever present) as well as from any subsequent code in this .Rmd file. Alternatively, you can add the missing column with default 0 values.

```{r verify record contents}

# Verify certain required columns are present.
verifyColList <- c("projID", "studyear", "communty", "HHID", "strata", recodeColList)

# Get a list of the missing columns
colList <- intersect(verifyColList, names(REC04Data))
colList <- verifyColList[!(verifyColList %in% colList)]

if(length(colList) > 0) {
  msgList = paste(colList, collapse=', ')
  cat(errorMessage(str_interp('Expected columns missing: ${msgList} <br> These will be added with 0 values; please verify this is accurate!')))
  
  REC04Data <- standardizeColumns(REC04Data, colList)
  
} else
{
  cat(greenMessage("REC04 successfully checked. All required columns are present."))
}

```

## Standardize coding

Evaluate columns of data used for development of tables and figures. Recode missing values to a single value for easier processing, rename columns as needed, and add missing community/resource records as needed. In this section the following steps take place:  
- Check for missing filterq data, report on results, standardize missing to -8 and recode harvest and use to -8 for all resources.  
- Recode all variables named in recodeColList to -8 if they are coded as any negative code.  
- For any resource added to any household that goes beyond the defaults on the printed survey, we need to add that to all other households. Note that the code allows us to retain certain key information, but it isn't required. By standardizing the resource list in this manner, summary statistics can be reliably computed using built-in R functions such as sd() and mean().  
- Recode variables to ensure proper handling of missing data. We interpret empty or missing data as 0 or NO. The reason for this is partially one of expediency in data processing, and also a matter of ensuring that when collected data is reviewed, it has been VERIFIED as some type of 'unknown' data.

Before analysis can begin or missing data addressed, reported amounts of harvest need to be standardized for each resource so that summaries for each resource are dealing with comparable units. 

To convert from the amount in reported units, which may differ from those that will be reported in the CSIS and technical papers, the following math is used:  

$$x \times unit_d = (x \times {unit_r}) * \left(\frac{b \times pounds}{1 \times unit_r}\right) * \frac{1}{\frac{b \times pounds}{1 \times unit_d}}$$  
Where:  
- $x \times unit_d = $ Amount of resource in default units d,  
- $x \times unit_r = $ Amount of resource in reported units r,  
- $\left(\frac{b \times pounds}{1 \times unit_r}\right) = $ The number of pounds (b) per 1 reported unit $unit_r$  
- $\frac{b \times pounds}{1 \times unit_d} = $ The number of pounds (b) per 1 default unit $unit_d$  

Note that both $\left(\frac{b \times pounds}{1 \times unit_r}\right) = $ and $\frac{b \times pounds}{1 \times unit_d} = $ are determined in the conversion factor tables (convFact.csv) and, whenever possible, should be obtained from the conversion factor database within the SDS. 

This process described above is handled in a standardized function: standardizeConvFact found in the f_standardizeConversionFactors.r file.
  
Identification of reported resources and units of harvest as well as default units need to have occurred BEFORE this step of the analysis can be run. If convFact.csv has not yet been developed or substantial corrections have occurred to the data, the conversion factors will need to be evaluated. Please run B03_PREP_CONVERSION_FACTOR.Rmd.

The table of resource/units to be converted may include apparent 'duplicate' resource. This is because if a household indicated pounds of Chinook salmon, for instance, then pounds of Chinook salmon were added to all households in an earlier step. This table will show ALL rows that were added as well as any added to households because of non-standard units. De-duplication via aggregation occurs in a later step.

```{r standardize units}

# Show resources that require unit standardization.
stdData <- left_join(REC04Data, convFactData, by=c("projID", "studyear", "communty", "resource","units")) %>%
  filter(units != defaultUnits) 
print(knitr::kable(stdData,
                   caption=formatTableHeader("Harvest records with non-standard units.")))

# Standardize units using standard Subsistence Methods.
REC04StdData <- standardizeConvFact(REC04Data, convFactData, c(harvAmtList, otherAmtList))


if(nrow(REC04StdData) == 0)
{
  cat(errorMessage(("Standardized conversion factors for REC04 produced no records - Have you remembered to update convFact.csv? - Records without standardized conversion factors will be used.")))
  
  REC04StdData <- REC04Data
  
} else {
  cat(formatSummaryBlock('Successfully Standardized units for all REC04 resource codes'))
}


```

## De-duplicate
Eliminate duplicates introduced when adding volunteered resources to the harvest record.

*NOTE* Please evaluate the code chunk below. Before finalizing this code and running analysis procedures, ensure that the columns below are a complete list of those that will be included in the final standardized file. Verify the following:

- Harvest rows are combined using sum() functions
- Binomial (yes/no) rows are combined using max() functions
- Key data used to identify unique household/resource/units (projID, studyear, HHID etc...) defind using group_by()
- Categorical information (ie: less/same/more) will be eliminated from this part of the processing. If that data exists per-species, a separate chunk starting with REC04_raw.csv should be written for processing.

*NOTE* If you receive a -InfWarning message regarding no missing arguments to max, you should have already received a message previously regarding missing data for the use/sharing questions. These are processed here.

```{r eliminate duplicates, message=FALSE}
# Eliminate duplicates.
REC04StdData <- group_by(REC04StdData, projID, studyear, communty, commname, commhh, 
                     samphh, sampPop, NHouseholds, strata, HHID, 
                     resource, units, strataWt, commPop,
                     NPopulation) %>%
  summarize(
    # Apply max() to these columns
    across(c(filterq,usuallyq,used,attempt,harvestq,received,giveaway), 
           ~max(., na.rm=TRUE)),
    # Apply sum() to these columns
    across(all_of(c(harvAmtList, otherAmtList)), 
           ~sum(., na.rm=TRUE)),
    # Ungroup to remove messages later
    .groups = "drop"
    )

count <- nrow(REC04StdData)

cat(formatSummaryBlock(
  str_interp('Removing duplicate rows. REC04 record count: ${count}')))

# Convert all Inf codes to NA.
REC04StdData <- inf_to_NA(REC04StdData, recodeColList)

```
## Process missing data

Prior to the development of harvest estimates, missing data must be properly handled. The Division of Subsistence standard relies on the following key assumptions:
- Missing data is sporadic, uniformly random, and free from discernible bias,
- Missing harvest data represents information believed to be consistent with the distribution of household harvests within the community as a whole.

From these assumptions, we extend the theorem that the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean (Cochran 1977) to resolve most instances of missing harvest data. Thus, a mean is calculated by gear-type, sex, month, location and/or age class and subsequently applied to all instances where some harvest was indicated but amounts not provided.

In the event that a single household indicated harvest of a resource, but did not provide an amount, we assume a 'minimum' replacement value of the strata or community minimum (for a simple random sample, these are the same). This is based on the assumption that the household DID harvest something, and therefore we know zero is not appropriate. Any value other value is speculation and must be justified. The minimum value is applied as the only reasonable replacement because we are assuming that the harvest was nonzero.

*NOTE* for the table below, verify that the total mean replaced harvest _MR is consistent with the sum of harvest amounts. Also verify that mean replacements (typically small amounts with decimal points) seem to make sense. Only rows with harvests are displayed.

<div class="todoBlock">Revise the mean replacement code so that it applies to defined gear types.</div>

```{r missing replacement, message=FALSE}

# Compute reported harvest amount.
REC04StdData <- rowwise(REC04StdData) %>% 
             mutate(reptHarvestAmt = sum(across(all_of(harvAmtList))))

# Mean replacements
REC04StdData <- dfMeanReplaceStratified(REC04StdData, replCols = harvAmtList, checkCol = "harvestq")

# Calculate mean replaced total harvest.
REC04StdData <- rowwise(REC04StdData) %>% 
  mutate(harvestAmt_MR = sum(across(all_of(harvAmtList))))

# Mean replaced data flag.
REC04StdData$mRepl = 0
REC04StdData$mRepl[is.na(REC04StdData$reptHarvestAmt) & REC04StdData$harvestAmt_MR > 0] = 1

tRec <- nrow(REC04StdData)
count <- sum(REC04StdData$mRepl)

if(count == 0) {
  cat(greenMessage(("There were NO missing-value replacements for harvests at the resource-code level.")))
} 
if(count / tRec > 0 &
   count / tRec < 0.07) {
  cat(warningMessage("Fewer than 7% of resource harvest records were marked as missing, refused, not asked, or unknown."))
  cat(warningMessage(paste(count, " records were replaced with the mean or minimum values.", sep='')))
} 
if(count / tRec >= 0.07) {
  cat(errorMessage(("More than 7% of resource harvest records were marked as missing, refused, not asked, or unknown. Please review surveys to ensure that no systematic or administration errors are present before continuing.")))
  cat(warningMessage(paste(count, " records were replaced with the mean or minimum values.", sep='')))
} 

# Mean replaced table for review.
tempData <- select(REC04StdData, commname, resource, HHID, mRepl, 
                   !!!syms(harvAmtList), 
                   harvestAmt_MR, units) %>%
    filter(harvestAmt_MR > 0) %>%
    arrange(desc(mRepl), desc(harvestAmt_MR))
knitr::kable(tempData,
             caption=formatTableHeader("Detail columns with mean replacements"),
             align="l")

```

## Estimated pounds

Now that mean replacements have occurred, a mean-replaced amount column will be calculated for use with an imputed estimated column. Computation of pounds harvested is also made at this time. In the table below, verify that the reported and mean replaced pounds appear to be correct and that all amounts are expanded. Only records with harvests are shown.

```{r harvest total columns}

# Bring back in conversion factors.
REC04StdData <- select(convFactData, projID, studyear, communty, resName, resource, units, convFact) %>%
  right_join(REC04StdData, by=c("projID", "studyear", "communty", "resource", "units"))

# Pounds harvested
REC04StdData$reptHarvestLbs = REC04StdData$reptHarvestAmt * REC04StdData$convFact 
REC04StdData$harvestLbs_MR = REC04StdData$harvestAmt_MR * REC04StdData$convFact 


# Pounds harvested table for review.
tempData <- select(REC04StdData, commname, resource, units, reptHarvestAmt, 
                   reptHarvestLbs, harvestAmt_MR, harvestLbs_MR) %>%
    filter(harvestAmt_MR > 0) %>%
    arrange(desc(harvestLbs_MR))
knitr::kable(tempData,
             caption=formatTableHeader("Reported harvest Amount & Pounds"),
             align="l")

```

## Insert missing columns & derived columns

```{r insert missing and derived columns}

# Number of columns.
count = length(REC04StdData)

# Start by enforcing logic rules.

# If a harvest amount is specified, ensure harvestq = 1
REC04StdData$harvestq[REC04StdData$harvestAmt_MR > 0] = 1

# If harvest occurred, then an attempt did as well.
REC04StdData$attempt[REC04StdData$harvestq == 1] = 1

# If any was harvested or given away, then we count it as used.
REC04StdData$used[REC04StdData$received == 1 | REC04StdData$harvestq == 1] = 1

# If an amount was reported as given away, but none harvested or 
#       recieved, we assume it came from a previous year
REC04StdData$giveaway[REC04StdData$received == 0 & REC04StdData$harvestq == 0] = 0

# Create any required, but missing columns, with defaults.
REC04StdData$specList = 1

# Add all of the columns that we don't already have.
REC04StdData <- standardizeColumns(REC04StdData, fullHarvColList)

count = length(REC04StdData) - count

cat(formatSummaryBlock(
  str_interp('${count} column names have been added to REC04.')))

```

## Create rows for CSIS aggregation.

Subsistence and rod and reel salmon harvests are recorded with the detail digit of 0 in the resource code. These are coded as detail digits of 3 and 2, respectively. For integration with CSIS and ensuring that species are properly combined with commercially retained resources, harvests are split into: Rod and reel and subsistence. Note that a specList = 1 column will be created for the original data and specList = 2 for the rows created to capture only rod and reel and the aggregate of subsistence gear types.

*NOTE* No distinction is made between personal use and subsistence gear in the CSIS  
*NOTE* Trolling gear is included with rod and reel because it is a strategy employed with rod and reel gear and would fall under applicable rod and reel gear regulations. We split this type out to highlight this important fishing strategy.

```{r CSIS rows}

count = nrow(REC04StdData)

# Split up the files
REC04RRData <- REC04StdData
REC04SubsData <- REC04StdData

# Format subsistence record.
REC04SubsData$resource = REC04SubsData$resource + 3
REC04SubsData$specList = 2

# Remove rod and reel
REC04SubsData$reptHarvestAmt = REC04SubsData$reptHarvestAmt - (REC04SubsData$amtRodReel + REC04SubsData$amtTrolling)
REC04SubsData$harvestAmt_MR = REC04SubsData$harvestAmt_MR - (REC04SubsData$amtRodReel + REC04SubsData$amtTrolling)
REC04SubsData$reptHarvestLbs = REC04SubsData$reptHarvestAmt * REC04SubsData$convFact
REC04SubsData$harvestLbs_MR = REC04SubsData$harvestAmt_MR * REC04SubsData$convFact
REC04SubsData$amtRodReel = 0
REC04SubsData$amtTrolling = 0

# Format rod and reel record.
REC04RRData$resource = REC04RRData$resource + 2
REC04RRData$specList =2

# Keep rod and reel only in a temp variable.
rrTemp = REC04RRData$amtRodReel 
trollTemp = REC04RRData$amtTrolling

# Note: This is an odd hack; however, when mean replacing, we assume a 
#     reptHarvAmt = NA in order to cope with the fact that the true measure
#     is unknown. Because we already mean-replaced at the gear-type level
#     we need to propagate that missing value into the reported harvest
#     amount. To do this, we can do this by subtracting the reported harvest
#     amount from itself and then adding back in rod and reel simultaneously.
REC04RRData$reptHarvestAmt = (REC04RRData$reptHarvestAmt - REC04RRData$reptHarvestAmt) + REC04RRData$amtRodReel + REC04RRData$amtTrolling
REC04RRData$harvestAmt_MR = REC04RRData$amtRodReel + REC04RRData$amtTrolling
REC04RRData$reptHarvestLbs = REC04RRData$reptHarvestAmt * REC04RRData$convFact
REC04RRData$harvestLbs_MR = REC04RRData$harvestAmt_MR * REC04RRData$convFact

# Now, clear out all harvest information, and re-add rod and reel.
REC04RRData <- assign_value_variables(REC04RRData, harvAmtList, 0)
REC04RRData$amtRodReel = rrTemp
REC04RRData$amtTrolling = trollTemp

# Merge and sort.
REC04CSISData <- bind_rows(REC04RRData, REC04SubsData) %>%
                 bind_rows(., REC04StdData) %>%
  arrange(projID, studyear, communty, strata, HHID, resource)
