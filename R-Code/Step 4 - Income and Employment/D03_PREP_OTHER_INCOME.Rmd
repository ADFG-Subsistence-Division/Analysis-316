# Prepare other income

Prepare the 'other income' data for analysis - execute mean replacements, enforce logic and ensure the file is clean and ready for analysis.

## Change log

### Change 1
- Programmer: D.S.Koster  
- Date: 05/21/2024  
- Change Description: Updated organization and formatting to be more consistent and provide better feedback/output.  
- Template Update [Y|N]: Y  
- One-Off: No-include in all future comprehensive templates 

### Change 2
- Programmer: D.S.Koster  
- Date: 06/07/2024  
- Change Description: Modified categories to provide categorization for virually all types of other income to avoid the 'Other non-employment' categories. This is likely to be noted as an issue by pubs as much as the problem it's seeking to solve, but it's the only step that doesn't involve defining 'other' in two ways.  
- Template Update [Y|N]: Y  
- One-Off: No-include in all future comprehensive templates 

### Change 3
- Programmer: Jesse Coleman
- Date: 03/18/2025
- Change Description: Removed source() calls; all functions are included in the library adfgSubs.
- Template Update [Y|N]: Y
- One-Off: No-include in all future comprehensive templates 

### Change 4
- Programmer: Jesse Coleman
- Date: 05/29/2025
- Change Description: Refactor using tidyverse language and DRY ("don't repeat yourself") principles.
- Template Update [Y|N]: Y
- One-Off: No - include in all future comprehensive templates

- Update 'Author' to your name  
- Update the project information in 'title' to the current project

## Additional information

This code creates a cross-listing of 'other income' codes to category type codes. The original purpose of this mapping was to highlight the role of government transfer payments within the overall income context. However, this led to unintuitive and confusing lumping of income categories such that two categories of 'other' were created. category codes are assigned in the code below.

# Set up files for analysis

This chunk recodes according to logic rules and prepare the dataset for missing data replacements.

```{r setp for analysis}

# 2.1 - Create income category.

#REC24Data$incCategory = 10
REC24Data <- REC24Data %>%
  left_join(incToCatData, by=c("incsrce")) %>% 
  mutate(incCategory = coalesce(incCategory, 10), # Default to 10 if NA
         # If the amount is explicitly missing, i.e., respondent noted some was earned, but none was listed, then
         #    force incReceived == 1, this way mean-replacement occurs properly.
         incReceived = case_when(amount < 0 ~ 1,
                                 is.na(incReceived) ~ 0,
                                 incReceived < 0 ~ NA_real_,
                                 TRUE ~ incReceived),
         # Recode income received and amount from -8 to NA
         amount = if_else(amount < 0, NA_real_, amount),
         # Also if the amount was marked as received, there needs to be a non-zero value.
         incomeAmount_MR = if_else(incReceived == 1 & amount == 0, NA_real_, amount)
  )

```

## Missing data replacement

Replace missing data by starting with the income source, if no non-0 mean is found for that source, then do this by income category. Again, if there is no mean, then take the mean of any source. Note here that we also evaluate whether or not the income source was present in another strata group before doing the whole community mean. This is rarely going to be applied.

```{r missing data replacement}

# Compute mean values for replacement, with NA removed
bySrceData <- REC24Data %>%
  group_by(samp, projID, studyear, communty, strata, incCategory, incsrce) %>%
  summarize(
    mByIncsrce = mean(incomeAmount_MR, na.rm = TRUE),
    mIncRcvedSrc = mean(incReceived, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

byCatData <- REC24Data %>%
  group_by(samp, projID, studyear, communty, strata, incCategory) %>%
  summarize(
    mByIncCat = mean(incomeAmount_MR, na.rm = TRUE),
    mIncRcvdCat = mean(incReceived, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

byAnyStrataData <- REC24Data %>%
  group_by(samp, projID, studyear, communty, strata) %>%
  summarize(
    mByAnyStrat = mean(incomeAmount_MR, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

byAnyCommData <- REC24Data %>%
  group_by(samp, projID, studyear, communty) %>%
  summarize(
    mByAny = mean(incomeAmount_MR, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Join mean values back to main data
REC24Data <- REC24Data %>%
  left_join(bySrceData, by = c("samp", "projID", "studyear", "communty", "strata", "incCategory", "incsrce")) %>%

  left_join(byAnyCommData, by = c("samp", "projID", "studyear", "communty"))

# Enforce logic for received income
REC24Data <- REC24Data %>%
  mutate(
    incReceived = if_else(incomeAmount_MR > 0, 1, incReceived),
    # Set to 0 if not received and no mean value for source
    incReceived = case_when(
      is.na(incReceived) & otherIncomeYN < 0 & (is.na(mIncRcvedSrc) | mIncRcvedSrc == 0) ~ 0,
      TRUE ~ incReceived
    ),
    incomeAmount_MR = case_when(
      is.na(incomeAmount_MR) & otherIncomeYN < 0 & (is.na(mIncRcvedSrc) | mIncRcvedSrc == 0) ~ 0,
      TRUE ~ incomeAmount_MR
    ),
    # Set means of 0 to NA so coalesce skips them
    mIncRcvedSrc = na_if(mIncRcvedSrc, 0),
    mIncRcvdCat = na_if(mIncRcvdCat, 0),
    mByIncsrce = na_if(mByIncsrce, 0),
    mByIncCat = na_if(mByIncCat, 0),
    mByAnyStrat = na_if(mByAnyStrat, 0),
    mByAny = na_if(mByAny, 0)
  )

# Coalesce incReceived from most to least specific
REC24Data <- REC24Data %>%
  mutate(
    incReceived = coalesce(incReceived, mIncRcvedSrc, mIncRcvdCat),
    incReceived = replace_na(incReceived, 0)
  )

# Coalesce incomeAmount_MR from most to least specific mean
REC24Data <- REC24Data %>%

```{r hh database file}

         reportedIncomeAmount = amount) %>% 
  select(-incsrce, -amount)

# Write CSV files
